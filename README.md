# LEARNING NEXT.JS

I encountered challenges while developing my Airbnb app, so I turned to YouTube tutorials and documentation for assistance. I'm simultaneously building the app and learning, with a specific focus on mastering page navigation in Next.js

## DAY 1
Day one was pretty easy. Setting up the environment and npm installing* what was neccessary for starts.

## Day 2
On the second day, my focus was on the navbar component.

The most valuable lesson I gained was about organizing files and folders in a manner that enhances your understanding of your own work. The key takeaway was the significance of file arrangement.

Initially, I used to: components > Navbar.tsx and dump everything there ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. However, working on this bnb project, specifically on the seemingly simple navabr with a logo, search, and menu, taught me the importance of file organization.

BREAKING DOWN EVEN THE SIMPLEST COMPONENTS AND ARRANGING THEM THOUGHTFULLY SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO CLARITY !!
